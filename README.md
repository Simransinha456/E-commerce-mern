# Create E-commerce Using MERN 
I developed an e-commerce website using the MERN stack technology stack. The front-end of the website display products, a shopping cart, and login/registration pages built with ReactJS. Additionally, I created backend functionalities using Express, Node.js, and MongoDB, along with ReactJS for certain components. These backend functionalities include APIs for adding, displaying, and updating products, managing cart items, and implementing user authentication and registration.
Moreover, I crafted an admin panel for the e-commerce website, facilitating product management such as adding and updating products.
